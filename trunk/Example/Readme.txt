This is an example usage of the DIS implementation.
It shows how to send/receive data to a DIS network.

The main idea is to use the library to pack and send/receive data.
The example socket implementation is outside the scope
of the DIS implementation, but provided so that the
testing is complete.  This socket implementation depends
upon the HawkNL library.  Please visit

for information about how to download, build, and install the SDK.
